# UFO Analysis Overview


The purpose of this analysis was working with Dana to create a table organizing UFO data stored in a JavaScript array.  Building in certain filters such as date, city, state, country, and shape makes the table more dynamic.  User input in the table will place a table into a new HTML file for better visualization and an overall viewing experience for users.

## Results 

Users have 5 different filters they can chose from which can help better define and narrow down a search.  For example, a user interested in seeing accounts of sightibgs in certain states can scroll down to the 3rd filter and search a state by abbreviation. In this case the user is curious about Colorado and will select the filter "co" to access all logged UFO reports in the state from 2010.

### Summary

One drawback about this webpage is that you need to reload the page to clear the filter. 

A larger dataset using different years could be an improvement for users wishing to compare other years to see if sigthings are going up or down in number.




In this module, you will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.
